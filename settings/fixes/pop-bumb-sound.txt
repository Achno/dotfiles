2) An insanely annoying popping / bump sound that i hear sometimes when a new video starts playing.

From what i gathered its an audio power saving thing and after following the below steps it fixes it sometimes but i still hear those pop sounds a lot but not to the degree i heard them before.

1. Change the value from 10 → 0

sudo nano /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save

2.Change Y → N

sudo nano /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save_controller

3.Make these changes persistent on reboot, add

options snd-hda-intel power_save=0 power_save_controller=N

inside this

sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
